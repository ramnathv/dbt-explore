## Dimensions

Add core dimension models in this folder, following these conventions.

1. Name the model `dim_<entity>`, where the entity is singular.
2. Namespace column names when there is scope for ambiguity.
3. Keep timestamps in both dimension and fact models as they are useful in both contexts.
